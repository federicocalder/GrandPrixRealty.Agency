## Deployment Notes

### GitHub SSH Authentication
The Hetzner server uses SSH key authentication for GitHub:
- SSH key is configured in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- `github.com` is in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`
- Git remote uses SSH URL: `git@github.com:federicocalder/GrandPrixRealty.Agency.git`

### Environment Variables
**Important**: `docker restart` does NOT reload `.env` files!

After editing `.env` on Hetzner, always use:
```bash
./update-env.sh gpr-seo-api  # For specific service
./update-env.sh              # For all services
```

### Under Construction Mode
- All pages show under construction by default
- Bypass: Visit any URL with `?access=gpr2025`
- Sets 30-day cookie `gpr_access=authorized`
- Configured in `deploy/nginx.conf`
