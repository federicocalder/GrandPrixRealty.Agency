Property managers serve as go-betweens for landlords and tenants. They take care of leases, rent collection, and research of rental markets. By communicating well with both parties, they keep relations peaceful and limit conflicts or problems.

Property managers are also responsible for maintenance management. They have to be quick to address any maintenance issues and arrange repairs or renovations. This way, they make sure tenants have a good experience and protect the value of the investment.

Plus, they manage marketing and tenant acquisition. They spread the word about available units, check tenants carefully, and help with the move-in process. Through screening, they try to reduce vacancies and get tenants who pay their rent on time.

An example of why property managers are essential? An apartment building experienced lots of tenant turnovers in a short time. The landlord wasn't doing proper maintenance, so the place was falling apart and no one wanted to live there.
