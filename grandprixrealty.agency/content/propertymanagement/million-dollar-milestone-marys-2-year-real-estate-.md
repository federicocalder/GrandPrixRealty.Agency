<p>In this Real Estate Investment Case Study we chronicle the extraordinary transformation of Mary, from a dedicated housekeeper to a real estate mogul, marking a journey that redefines the essence of the American Dream and underscores the power of strategic investment and unwavering ambition now with about $15,000/Month in gross rental income</p>

<p>Meet Mary, a resilient immigrant living the American Dream through astute real estate investments. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Having embarked on this transformative two-year journey under my mentorship, Mary transitioned from a housekeeping job earning $16 per hour to retirement. Today, she thrives solely on the returns from her real estate portfolio, a testament to the financial empowerment achieved through strategic real estate investment.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our journey begins with Mary, who entered my professional sphere through her husband, an esteemed client. Although I've never had the pleasure of meeting her in person, our connection began in February 2020. </p>

<pre class="wp-block-verse has-theme-palette-1-color has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Mary</strong>, <strong>armed with a vision and a determination to succeed in real estate investment, sought my guidance.</strong></pre>

<p>As we delve into the intricacies of the challenges faced, it's essential to note that, initially, her personal tax situation didn't align with the stringent standards for mortgage qualification. </p>

<p>Undeterred, we strategized for the future. It was decided that come January of the following year, we would reconvene to meticulously structure her taxes, ensuring readiness for mortgage lending.</p>

<p>At that point, Mary already owned three properties:</p>

<ol>
<li class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Her Owner-Occupied Home (details kept private)</strong></li>

<li class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>XXXX La Brea, Las Vegas NV:</strong> A strategic investment acquired during the 2008 recession, the property was fully paid off, generating significant equity. (rental)</li>

<li class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>XXXX Lone Canyon, North Las Vegas NV</strong> (rental)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Balance Sheet of Mary (2020)</h3>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Assets</th><th>2021 Value</th><th>Loan Balance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Owner-Occupied Property (Private)</td><td>$225,000</td><td>$125,000</td></tr><tr><td>XXXX La Brea, Las Vegas NV</td><td>$245,000</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>XXXX Lone Canyon, North Las Vegas NV</td><td>$260,000</td><td>$97,000</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Assets</strong></td><td><strong>$730,000</strong></td><td><strong>$232,000</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Please note that the values for 2023/24 were not factored into this calculation as we are focusing on the 2021 balance sheet.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Now, let's calculate the Net Worth:</p>

<p>Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities</p>

<p>Net Worth = $730,000 - ($125,000 + $0 + $97,000) = <strong>$508,000</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mary's net worth in 2020 is $508,000.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And so begins our journey—a journey that would see her real estate assets surpassing $2 Millions in under two years, accompanied by a substantial monthly rental income exceeding $15,000.</strong></p>

<h3>Mary's Rental Income Statement as of 2020:</h3>

<p>An income statement, often referred to as a profit and loss statement, is a vital financial tool for real estate investors. </p>

<p>It provides a snapshot of an investor's rental property earnings, revealing how efficiently their investments are performing. </p>

<p>This statement helps investors track income, expenses, and profitability, aiding in informed decision-making and property management. </p>

<p>By regularly updating and analyzing an income statement, investors can optimize their real estate portfolios for maximum returns.</p>

<p>Please Note: Her self-managed Rental Income in 2020 was $1,650.00 per month; however, the true potential, utilizing a property manager, could reach up to $2,700.00.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Actual Income</th><th>Potential Income</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>XXXX La Brea</td><td>$800</td><td>$1,300</td></tr><tr><td>XXXX Lone Canyon</td><td>$850</td><td>$1,400</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Rental Property Income Before Strategic Management (Potential vs. Actual)</figcaption></figure>

<h2>Client Background:</h2>

<p>Mary approached our journey with a clear vision—she aspired to invest in real estate and leverage the equity from the sale of XXXX La Brea to fulfill her dream of owning a 4plex multifamily unit.</p>

<p>As January 2021 unfolded, we embarked on a crucial phase of the process. I provided comprehensive guidance on optimizing her tax strategy—a vital aspect for any real estate investor. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"><strong>The recommendations were twofold:</strong></h3>

<p><strong>1) Declaration of Rental Income:</strong></p>

<p>It was advised that all rental income derived from her real assets, including depreciation, needed to be appropriately declared. This step ensures a transparent and compliant financial approach.</p>

<p><strong>2) Depreciation Declaration:</strong></p>

<p>Another key facet involved the declaration of depreciation from real assets. This strategic move not only aligns with best practices but also maximizes potential benefits.</p>

<p>By February 2021, Mary's tax situation was meticulously structured, aligning with these recommendations. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>It's important to note that this guidance serves as a proactive measure for real estate investors, emphasizing the significance of transparent and comprehensive financial reporting. </strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This approach ensures compliance with regulations and positions investors for long-term success.</p>

<h3>Taxes Leverage for Real Estate Investors</h3>

<p>In the realm of real estate investment, one key element that demanded attention was the concept of depreciation.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-theme-palette-3-color has-text-color has-link-color"><strong>1) Depreciation as a Write-Off:</strong></h4>

<p>Depreciation in real estate is a financial tool that offers investors a valuable write-off. It allows the gradual allocation of the property's cost over time. This means that a portion of the property's value can be deducted from taxable income each year, serving as a significant tax advantage for investors.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-theme-palette-3-color has-text-color has-link-color"><strong>2) Depreciation as Additional Income:</strong></h4>

<p>Beyond being a tax write-off, depreciation also holds the unique characteristic of transforming into income. </p>

<p>As a practical reference, consider the <a href="https://grandprixrealty.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Form1038.Calculator.0420.pdf">FNMA Form 1038 Rental Income Worksheet</a>. In line A7 of this form, depreciation is added back, highlighting its role as an essential component of additional income calculation. This form exemplifies how strategic management of depreciation can contribute to the overall financial health of a real estate investor.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image is-style-rounded"><img src="https://grandprixrealty.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1024x93.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1382"/></figure>

<p>Understanding and strategically leveraging depreciation not only contribute to reducing tax liabilities but also enhance the overall income of a real estate investor. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>By incorporating this financial tool into Mary's tax structure, we ensured that she not only benefited from write-offs but also positioned herself for higher income and Lower DTI Ratios.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Challenges Faced:</h2>

<p>The primary challenge encountered in Mary's real estate journey centered around the intricate landscape of her tax situation. </p>

<p>Given the complexity of tax requirements and their pivotal role in real estate transactions, addressing this challenge became a focal point.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size">I. The Starting Point: From First Sale to Success: Mary's Real Estate Journey</h2>

<p><strong>At the outset of her remarkable journey, Mary demonstrated a pragmatic resolve, viewing her initial sacrifice of selling 'La Brea' not with attachment or regret, but as a strategic move — embodying the true essence of a savvy investor detached from emotional biases and focused squarely on long-term gains</strong></p>

<h2>Navigating Success: The Strategic Sale of XXXX La Brea, Las Vegas NV</h2>

<p>We listed <strong>La Brea</strong> on 11/10/2020, strategically approaching the new year when tax considerations align favorably for lending. </p>

<p>Despite the winter market's typically slower pace, we secured an accepted offer on 01/08/2021. </p>

<p>The culmination of this strategic approach led to the successful closing of the sale on 02/28/2021, achieving a sales price of $245,000.</p>

<p>Mary's final proceeds, after covering all closing costs and commissions to agents, amounted to a substantial $223,817.73.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://grandprixrealty.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/00LABREA-SS_Flatten_Flatten.pdf">Final Certified Settlement Statement</a> encapsulates not just a successful sale, but a testament to the artistry of strategic real estate listing.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://grandprixrealty.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1383"/></figure>

<h2>Strategic Wealth Preservation: The Power of a 1031 Exchange in Real Estate Investment</h2>

<p>In the strategic landscape of real estate, precision becomes paramount, and one such crucial move in Mary's journey involved recommending the deposit of her proceeds into a 1031 exchange. </p>

<p>This tactical decision isn't just about deferring capital gains taxes; it's a methodical approach to wealth preservation. </p>

<p>By opting for a 1031 exchange, Mary gains the advantage of reinvesting her funds into new properties without immediate tax implications. </p>

<p>The challenge, however, lies in the clock ticking against time. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>The IRS stipulates a stringent timeframe for identifying and submitting targeted properties. </strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This demands a meticulous and swift collaboration with professionals who excel in precision—a team capable of navigating the intricacies of a 1031 exchange with adeptness, ensuring Mary maximizes the benefits within the regulatory framework.</p>

<p>In orchestrating the intricacies of Mary's 1031 exchange, the pivotal role of the asset manager, Patrick Stanczyk, Assistant Vice President | Exchange Officer at Investment Property Exchange Services, Inc. (IPX1031), cannot be overstated. </p>

<p>Patrick's dedication to excellence manifested in unparalleled customer service, professionalism, and clear communication throughout the exchange process. </p>

<p>His commitment to precision and efficiency ensured a seamless transition, elevating the experience for all involved. </p>

<p>For those seeking a knowledgeable and adept partner in 1031 exchanges, Patrick Stanczyk emerges as a beacon of reliability. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size">II. Heeding Guidance: The Second Step in Mary's Real Estate Journey</h2>

<p>Mary's second crucial step, pivotal in her transformative journey, was embracing my expert advice, a decision that unlocked new realms of possibilities and steered her path towards unprecedented real estate success.</p>

<h2>Strategic Pivot: Transforming Dreams into Short-Term Rental Success</h2>

<p><strong>In a remarkable shift, Mary now stands with over $220,000 ready for strategic investment. </strong></p>

<p>Eager to fulfill her dream of a 4plex, she encountered an unexpected redirection. </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>"Mary... consider purchasing a 4-bedroom property with a pool in a desirable neighborhood and explore short-term rentals," I advised. </strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initially met with bewilderment, Mary, a determined housekeeper with aspirations, paused to consider the unfamiliar territory I presented. </p>

<p>Recognizing the importance of mentorship, she embraced the idea the following day. </p>

<p>Why the shift to 4 bedrooms and a pool? </p>

<p><strong>Simple—success leaves clues. </strong></p>

<p>Several of my investors have found immense returns, around $100,000 per year, through similar properties listed on <a href="https://grandprixrealty.agency/airbnb-property-management" data-type="post" data-id="427">short-term rental</a> platforms. </p>

<p>This strategic shift aims not just for property ownership but for the optimal return on investment in Mary's burgeoning real estate journey.</p>

<h3>Turning Visions into Profits: The Strategic Acquisition of a Lucrative Short-Term Rental Property</h3>

<p>In the pursuit of short-term rental success, our quest led us to the perfect investment on the west side of town—a splendid 4-bedroom house with a pool. </p>

<p>This remarkable property, acquired at $470,000, has become a beacon of success, generating an impressive annual income exceeding $90,000 through short-term rentals. </p>

<p>The strategic move involved a calculated financial commitment, with a 20% downpayment, closing costs, and a $5,000 earnest money deposit totaling $105,063.90. </p>

<p>The initial investment has manifested into a lucrative venture, showcasing the potential for outstanding returns and setting the stage for continued success in Mary's real estate portfolio.</p>

<p>Dive into the numbers, dissect the details, and let's uncover the lessons embedded in every line of this significant transaction.</p>

<h2>From Dream to Reality: Mary's Journey to Owning a 4plex</h2>

<p>Mary's dream of owning a strategic investment property came to life in the form of a meticulously crafted 4plex. </p>

<p>Here's the captivating story of her journey:</p>

<h3>The Property Hunt:</h3>

<p>Mary, fueled by determination, scoured Zillow for potential investments. </p>

<p>Some were distant, and a few were triplexes with notable drawbacks. </p>

<p>Notably, one lacked a central HVAC system, a non-negotiable for Mary's discerning eye. (Lower rental potential)</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong>Recognizing her openness to properties beyond Las Vegas, I reached out to a trusted developer in Pahrump. </strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>An exciting Investment Opportunity emerged—a custom-built 4plex with 25% downpayment, promising spectacular finishes, and unique features.</strong></p>

<h3>Unlocking the Potential: Understanding Pre-construction Purchases in Real Estate</h3>

<p>The type of real estate purchase where the buyer puts down a downpayment, and the developer or builder starts building the property is commonly referred to as a "Preconstruction Purchase" or "Preconstruction Contract." </p>

<p>In this arrangement, the buyer essentially secures a property that is yet to be built, often at an earlier stage of development or even before construction begins.</p>

<p>Here's a brief overview of how a preconstruction purchase typically works:</p>

<ol>
<li class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Reservation and Downpayment:</strong> <br><br>The buyer expresses interest in a property within a development project and provides a reservation fee or downpayment to secure their interest.<br></li>

<li class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Contract Agreement:</strong> <br><br>A formal contract is drawn up between the buyer and the developer, outlining the terms and conditions of the purchase, including the agreed-upon price, construction timeline, and any other relevant details.<br></li>

<li class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Construction Commences:</strong> <br><br>Once the contract is signed, the developer proceeds with the construction of the property.<br></li>

<li class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Progress Payments:</strong> <br><br>In many cases, the buyer makes progress payments at key construction milestones, such as the completion of the foundation, framing, or other significant stages.<br></li>

<li class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Final Closing:</strong> <br><br>The final closing occurs once the property is completed and ready for occupancy. At this point, the buyer takes possession of the property, and the remaining balance is paid (Cash or Refinance transaction through a lending institution)</li>
</ol>

<p>Preconstruction purchases can offer several advantages, including the potential for customization, the opportunity to secure a property at a lower price before market appreciation, and the ability to plan finances and investments accordingly. </p>

<p>However, they also come with certain risks, such as construction delays or changes in the real estate market.</p>

<p><strong>It's essential for buyers entering into preconstruction contracts to carefully review all terms and conditions and work with legal and real estate professionals to ensure a smooth and successful transaction.</strong></p>

<h3>Architectural Brilliance:</h3>

<p>Despite a long delay due to pandemic-related supply chain disruptions, the 4plex, completed in November 2022, stands as a marvel of modern architecture. </p>

<p>Comprising two 2-bedroom and two 3-bedroom units, each unit is equipped with individual electrical and water meters, exemplifying the essence of efficient leasing. </p>

<p><strong>This arrangement means no utility bills under Mary's name, as tenants cover all utilities, with my company handling property management.</strong></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://grandprixrealty.agency/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_4671_2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1415"/></figure>

<h3>Supply Chain Challenges and Delay:</h3>

<p>Initiated in March 2021, the project faced significant hurdles, including supply chain disruptions and financing challenges due to the pandemic. </p>

<p>However, the property's appraised value at completion stood at an impressive $580,000. </p>

<p><strong>Mary, being understanding, received a $10,000 good faith compensation from the developer for the delays, solidifying a promising future partnership.</strong></p>

<h3>Blueprints and Property Details:</h3>

<p>Enclosed in this blog post are the blueprints, showcasing the 4plex's architectural design. Located on a 14,000 sq ft plot in Pahrump, NV, it adheres to local zoning regulations. </p>

<p>With the property value reaching $600,000 as of December 2023, this investment boasts a remarkable 10.4% capitalization rate. The monthly rental income totals $5,200, offering a substantial return.</p>

<h2>The Dream Realized: From Vision to Reality - Mary's 4plex Journey Culminates</h2>

<p>Mary's real estate journey, which began as a vision of investing in a 4plex, has now become a resounding reality. </p>

<p>It's been a transformative odyssey, filled with strategic planning, construction delays, and unwavering determination.</p>

<p>The initial step involved the strategic sale of a previous property, La Brea, to pave the way for the 1031 exchange, a crucial move to maintain compliance with tax regulations. </p>

<p>The 90-day window to identify properties and the subsequent 30-day deadline (for a total of 120 days) for closing during a hot market presented a formidable challenge. Still, we persevered, securing properties that met Mary's investment goals.</p>

<p>Then came the construction phase, which extended beyond the anticipated timeline due to COVID-related supply chain disruptions. </p>

<p>Yet, the developer's commitment to quality was unwavering. The 4plex took shape, with impeccable finishes and a design tailored for optimal returns.</p>

<p>Delays tested our patience, but they also offered an unexpected reward. </p>

<p>The property's appraised value soared to $580,000 upon completion, securing an equity gain of $80,000 even before construction ended. </p>

<p>As a gesture of goodwill, the developer compensated Mary with $10,000 for the delays, further enhancing the investment's potential.</p>

<p>With the Certificate of Occupancy in hand, signaling compliance with county regulations and safety standards, Mary's dream was realized. </p>

<p>The 4plex was officially ready for occupancy, and the final closing marked the beginning of a new chapter—a journey where Mary's astute real estate investments would thrive, generating income and financial security.</p>

<p>The dream that began with a vision, navigated through complexities, and weathered delays has culminated in a tangible and lucrative investment. </p>

<p>Mary's unwavering determination, combined with strategic guidance and the dedication of professionals like Leslie and Patrick, has led to the transformation of her vision into a prosperous reality.</p>

<p>As we turn the key to open the doors of this 4plex to tenants and renters, we embark on a new phase of Mary's investment journey—one where the dream of financial empowerment through real estate becomes an ongoing and ever-evolving reality.</p>

<h3>Renting Success: The Flourishing Income Stream of Mary's 4plex Investment</h3>

<p>With the keys to the 4plex in hand and the Certificate of Occupancy secured, it was time to unleash the earning potential of this strategic investment. </p>

<p>Following a meticulously crafted marketing plan, which you can explore in detail in <a href="https://grandprixrealty.agency/your-ultimate-property-marketing-plan" data-type="post" data-id="1212">Your Ultimate Property Marketing Plan</a>, we set the stage for success.</p>

<p>The property made its debut on the MLS and various syndication websites, accompanied by captivating YouTube videos that showcased the 4plex's allure. </p>

<p>Additionally, we tapped into Section 8 affordable housing websites, casting a wide net to attract potential tenants.</p>

<p>The results were impressive. Two Section 8 tenants found their new home in the spacious 3-bedroom units, each contributing $1,350 per month in rental income. </p>

<p>Simultaneously, regular tenants snapped up the 2-bedroom units, creating a steady stream of rental income. </p>

<p>In total, the 4plex generates an impressive $5,200 in monthly rental income.</p>

<p>This accomplishment is particularly noteworthy when compared to the rental market landscape in Las Vegas, where some older 4plex's rent for under $1,000 per month per unit, (Type-C and Type-D properties) they don't even reach the Type-B categories, and most even have the added expense of HOA fees. </p>

<p>In contrast, Mary's investment not only provides superior returns but also offers a more attractive and cost-effective choice for tenants, making it an exceptional addition to her real estate portfolio.</p>

<h2>Expanding the Real Estate Portfolio: A Type-B Investment</h2>

<p>After the successful acquisition of her 4plex and the realization of her major life dream, Mary wasn't content to stop there. </p>

<p>Her ambition drove her to set her sights on yet another real estate venture, this time in the coveted Summerlin area. </p>

<p>In September 2021, she seized the opportunity to purchase a charming single-story house with three bedrooms and a refreshing pool. </p>

<p>The seller? Zillow itself.</p>

<p>This astute investment, initially valued at $350,000, has proven to be a wise choice. </p>

<p>As of December 2023, the property has appreciated significantly, with an estimated worth of approximately $420,000. </p>

<p>A tenant currently occupies this attractive home, contributing $2,200 in monthly rental income. </p>

<p>While it's currently categorized as a Type-B property due to no major renovations since the purchase, the potential for increased rental income through strategic updates is evident.</p>

<p>To facilitate this new investment, Mary opted for a cash-out refinance of her existing investment property on XXXX Lone Canyon. </p>
