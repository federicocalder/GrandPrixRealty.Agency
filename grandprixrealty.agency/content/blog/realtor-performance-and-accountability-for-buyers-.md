<p>My home isn’t selling. Should I change Realtors? If your agent made a compelling pitch with a list of marketing strategies and high-energy promises, but your home is still sitting unsold, it’s time to evaluate. Did they truly follow through, or did their enthusiasm fizzle once the contract was signed?</p>

<h3>Assessing Your Realtor's Efforts</h3>
<p>When you first signed with your Realtor, they likely laid out a game plan filled with selling strategies—social media blasts, open houses, professional photography, and targeted advertisements. But have those plans turned into action? A strong real estate agent relentlessly pursues the best marketing strategies to get your home the visibility it needs.</p>

<p>Some critical areas to examine:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Did they showcase your home with high-quality listing photos and virtual tours?</li>
    <li>Was your property advertised across multiple platforms, including MLS, social media, and real estate websites?</li>
    <li>Did they host open houses and private showings to expose your home to serious buyers?</li>
    <li>Were they proactive in seeking feedback from potential buyers and using it to improve the listing?</li>
</ul>

<h3>When Promises Go Unfulfilled</h3>
<p>If you're left questioning your Realtor’s contribution or feel like you’re doing more to push the sale than they are, that’s a red flag. Selling a home requires ongoing effort, and if your agent isn’t meeting expectations, reconsidering whether to switch might be in your best interest.</p>

<p>Pay attention to these signs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your home’s marketing materials look unpolished or incomplete.</li>
    <li>You rarely hear from your Realtor except when you reach out first.</li>
    <li>Open houses or showings are not scheduled consistently.</li>
    <li>Your listing isn't appearing in key real estate advertising channels.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to Do Before Making a Change</h3>
<p>Before you decide to change Realtors, have a candid conversation. Express your concerns and ask for specific action steps moving forward. If their promises continue to fall short, it may be time to move on.</p>

<p>When interviewing a new Realtor, look for someone with a proven track record and visible marketing strategies. Read their client reviews, assess their online presence, and ensure they bring innovation and commitment to the table.</p>

<p>My home isn’t selling. Should I change Realtors? One of the most critical responsibilities of a Realtor is maintaining consistent communication with interested buyers. If your home is getting showings but no offers, or worse, no feedback, it might be time to assess whether your agent is actually following up with prospects.</p>

<h3>The Power of Buyer Engagement</h3>
<p>Real estate isn't just about listing properties; it’s about relationships. A dedicated Realtor ensures that every person who walks through your home, inquires about it online, or shows even the slightest interest gets a follow-up. The goal is to keep potential buyers engaged and move them toward making an offer.</p>

<p>Here’s what effective buyer follow-up looks like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Contacting all visitors after a showing to gather their thoughts and assess their interest.</li>
    <li>Addressing objections by providing solutions, such as suggesting minor changes or negotiating seller incentives.</li>
    <li>Keeping in touch with buyer agents to gauge whether their clients might be ready to move forward.</li>
    <li>Sending gentle reminders about the home, particularly if there's a price adjustment or an added incentive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Signs Your Realtor May Not Be Following Up</h3>
<p>If your home has been on the market for weeks and you have little to no feedback, it’s a problem. A proactive agent gathers insights from buyer showings and uses that data to refine the strategy. If your agent isn’t doing this, you’re left in the dark about why buyers aren’t making offers.</p>

<p>Warning signs to watch for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Showings happen, but you’re not receiving any buyer feedback.</li>
    <li>You don’t know if buyers are interested because your agent isn’t checking in.</li>
    <li>Your Realtor rarely updates you on potential buyer activity or next steps.</li>
    <li>You have no idea how your home compares to other listings buyers are considering.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Taking Action Before Changing Realtors</h3>
<p>Before deciding to change Realtors, have an open discussion. Ask them about their follow-up process and request more transparency. A good agent will welcome this conversation and implement immediate changes to strengthen buyer engagement.</p>

<p>However, if radio silence continues and you still feel like your home is being neglected, it may be time to explore new representation. A successful sale depends on constant communication and a proactive approach. My home isn’t selling. Should I change Realtors? If your agent isn’t following up with potential buyers, the answer could be a definitive yes.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">>>Is Your Home Priced Correctly for the Market?<<</h2>

<p>My home isn’t selling. Should I change Realtors? Before you make the switch, ask yourself: is your home priced correctly for the market? Even a top-tier real estate agent will struggle to attract buyers if the price isn’t right. If your home has been listed for months without serious inquiries, pricing may be the issue—not necessarily your Realtor.</p>

<h3>Understanding Market Pricing for Your Home</h3>
<p>Pricing a home isn’t an arbitrary decision. It requires a strategic balance between market demands, comparable sales, and perceived value. A home priced too high will scare off buyers before they even schedule a showing. A price too low might raise concerns about hidden issues or leave money on the table. </p>

<p>A skilled Realtor will perform a <strong>Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)</strong> and suggest a competitive price based on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Recent sale prices of similar homes in your neighborhood.</li>
    <li>Square footage, condition, and unique features of your property.</li>
    <li>Current inventory and demand—are homes selling quickly or sitting for months?</li>
    <li>Market trends, including interest rate fluctuations and seasonal buyer behaviors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Signs Your Home May Be Overpriced</h3>
<p>If buyers aren’t biting, it may not be your Realtor’s fault—it could be the price tag that’s scaring them away. Watch for these warning signs that your home might be priced too high:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your home has been listed for weeks or months with minimal or no showings.</li>
    <li>There's a significant gap between your asking price and what comparable homes are selling for.</li>
    <li>Agents and buyers remark that your price is "a bit high" but aren’t making offers.</li>
    <li>Nearby homes with similar features have sold, but yours remains unsold.</li>
</ul>

<p>Buyers today are savvier than ever, with instant access to market data. If your home’s price doesn’t align with reality, they may not even bother scheduling a tour.</p>

<h3>The Power of a Smart Pricing Strategy</h3>
<p>If your home is priced correctly, it should generate steady interest—whether through showings, inquiries, or online traffic. If none of that is happening, consider a price adjustment. This doesn't necessarily mean undervaluing your home but rather adjusting it to better match buyer expectations.</p>

<p>Some effective pricing strategies include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reducing the price slightly to fall into a different search bracket.</li>
    <li>Offering seller incentives such as closing cost assistance or home warranties.</li>
    <li>Reevaluating the listing after gathering buyer feedback.</li>
    <li>Testing a new pricing strategy based on comparable sales and current market conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to Reassess Your Realtor vs. the Price</h3>
<p>The right agent will be transparent about market realities. If your Realtor has suggested price adjustments but you’ve resisted, the lack of offers might be due to pricing, not their performance. However, if your agent hasn't provided a clear pricing strategy or market analysis, it may be time to question whether they’re taking the right approach.</p>

<p>My home isn’t selling. Should I change Realtors? If your agent hasn’t proactively advised on pricing or presented solutions, it may be worth exploring new representation. But before making that call, ensure the price truly reflects market conditions—because even the best Realtor can’t sell an overpriced home.</p>
